## Usage

``` sh
./cursedngrams.py 3 The ship <moby-dick.txt
```

The program reads a sequence of `WORDS` from the standard input, breaks
`WORDS` into `N`-grams, and uses the `N`-grams to continue the sequence
`START`.

Details:

-   `WORDS` are split by any whitespace character.
-   `N` should be greater than 0.
-   `START` needs at least one word to work.

## Roadmap

-   Make it more cursed.
